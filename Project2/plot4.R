#First, we need to dig-in to SCC file to search for 
#the source numbers which consume Coal
#Using View from plyr package to check the SCC file. 

#We can see that "short-name" and "El.sector" might contain Coal, but it does not indicate
#that Coal is their fuel~ it only presents in which industrial sectors 
#they are. 

#A good place to search for Coal-Combustion sources are in SCC.Level.One-Four. 
#we use grepl to check which level are relevant, and we see 
#Level Three and Level Four contains our key word "Coal".
